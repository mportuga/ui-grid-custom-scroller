# ui-grid-custom-scroller
The custom scrolling feature takes over the default scrolling logic in order to ensure that grid scrolling works without a lag on devices. To enable, you must include the 'ui.grid.customScrolling' module and you must include the ui-grid-custom-scrolling directive on your grid element.
